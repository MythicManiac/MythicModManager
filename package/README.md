place where you're happy with storing mods as well.

_NOTE: If you have a non-standard game install location, modify
`config.toml` accordingly_

_NOTE: MythicModManager best works with a clean game installation, which
includes removing any and all existing mods._

_NOTE: The game has to be relaunched every time new mods are installed or
uninstalled._
