# Mythic Mod Manager

## Features

- Download and install mods directly from the manager
- Enable and disable mods without having to redownload
- Export and import mod setups, easy way to share same mods with a friend

## Upcoming features

- Updating mods (in a more automated fashion)
- Thunderstore install button support

## Known limitations

- Only BepInEx plugins are installable via the mod manager
- Mods that aren't _BepInEx_ plugins (e.g. MonoMod plugins) will be "installed",
but not actually work
- Updating mods currently only works by disabling and re-enabling them, as
enabling will always pull the latest version

## Installation and usage

1. Extract the downloaded zip file anywhere on your system. This should be a
place where you're happy with storing mods as well.
2. Launch `MythicModManager.exe`
3. ???
4. Profit

_NOTE: If you have a non-standard Risk of Rain 2 install location, modify
`config.json` accordingly_

_NOTE: MythicModManager best works with a clean Risk of Rain installation, which
includes removing all existing mods._

_NOTE: The game has to be relaunched every time new mods are installed or
uninstalled._
